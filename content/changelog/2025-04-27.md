[MJMLiquid](https://www.mjmliquid.com) has been live since Dec 2024, so this changelog is way overdue. Nonetheless, here's the release features.

# Features
* _Preview templates on different devices._ Make use of the `alt` + `1` hotkey to select the default mobile 📱 and desktop 🖥️ viewports or manually enter the viewports you're looking to test.

* _Quickly update and preview your [liquid template data](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid)._ People have been asking about the differences between Local 🏡 and Shared 🌍 liquid. Essentially, these combine to the same JSON data under the hood - it looks to provide you flexibility in configuring what liquid data you need to change (local) and what you need to stay constant (shared) between different email templates.

* _Facilities to quickly copy previewed data._ Copy the template data you've editted on MJMLiquid quickly into your clipboard so you can paste the editted template where you require!

* _Fullscreen mode for a better developer experience._ A need, not a want 🚀.

* Outside of these are of course the _hotkeys_ which I've configured to try and make using MJMLiquid as fun as possible - read more on the inception of this [here](https://kokwee.com/blog/hotkeys-galore)!
